# Typist

Minimal single-player typing practice built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default the dev server listens on port `5173`. Use `npm run dev -- --port <port>` to override when needed.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces a static bundle in `dist/`. The directory is excluded from version control in `.gitignore`.
